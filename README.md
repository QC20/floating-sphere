2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. You should see a rotating mesh rendered in the browser window.

## Features

- Simple setup for a Three.js scene.
- Rotating mesh animation.
- Basic lighting setup.

## Getting Started

To get started with using this WebGL renderer, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can then modify the `app.js` file to customize the scene and mesh to your liking.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the Three.js library for WebGL rendering. Make sure to include the Three.js library in your project to use this renderer.
